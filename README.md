# Event Management Website
# About the project itself 

-Okay, the i wants to create an event management website using React for the frontend. Let me break down the requirements

First, the main structure is clear: a landing page with several sections, and additional pages for About, Gallery, Services, etc. Let me go through each point step by step.

1. **Landing Page**: They mentioned Header, Hero, About Us, Services in gallery cards, Get In Touch, and Footer. The Header needs a logo on the left, a menu with specific items, and a search bar. The Hero section has a changing image slider with a title. I should suggest using a carousel component for the Hero images, maybe with auto-rotate and transition effects. For the Header, responsive design is important, so a hamburger menu for mobile would be good. The search bar could have autocomplete for events or services.
2. **About Us Page**: They want a hero image with text, followed by sections like Who We Are, Vision/Mission, What We Do, and Testimonials. For testimonials, using a carousel or cards with client quotes and ratings would be nice. A timeline of company milestones could add depth.
3. **Gallery Page**: Display images provided by the user. Suggest a masonry layout for dynamic grid, filtering by event type, and lightbox on click. Maybe categorize images into tabs like Weddings, School Events, etc.
4. **Services Page**: Card-style listing. Each card should have an image, title, short description, and a "Learn More" button. Hover effects on cards would enhance UX. Grouping services into categories with tabs or filters could help users navigate.
5. **Packages Page**: The user will provide ideas later, but I can suggest pre-designed packages with comparisons, pricing, inclusions, and a CTA to customize.
6. **Custom Booking Page**: A form with fields for event type, date, location, budget, etc. Should include validation, a progress indicator, and a preview summary. Maybe a calendar widget for date selection and a file upload for reference images.
7. **Contact Page**: A form with name, email, message, plus contact info like address, phone, and social media links. A map showing outlets using an API like Google Maps would be useful. Adding a FAQ section could preempt common questions.
8. **Outlets Page**: Image cards with location. Each card could have an image, address, phone, and hours. An interactive map with markers for each outlet would help. Filtering outlets by city or region might be helpful.

Additional ideas: The user might need a blog for event tips, social media integration and SEO optimization with meta tags. For UI, a consistent theme with modern fonts and animations would look professional. Using React Router for navigation, state management(redux toolkit) for forms, and a CSS framework like Tailwind or Material-UI or shadcn could speed up development.

I should also remind them to gather all content (images, text) early, consider accessibility, and plan for responsiveness. Maybe suggest a phased approach, starting with core pages and adding features incrementally.

most used:
Use a consistent color scheme (gold/white for luxury, or vibrant colors)

Implement micro-animations for button interactions

Include loading skeletons for API calls

Create custom illustrations for empty states
use the shadcn UI for the different components
and color theme
